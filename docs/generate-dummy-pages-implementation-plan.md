# Step-by-Step Implementation Plan for Requirement 7: Generate HTML Code for Each Page

## 1. Review Layout Files
- Identify and review all referenced layout files in `docs/layouts/` (e.g., `layout-homepage.md`, `layout-product.md`, etc.).
- Note the structure, sections, and key elements in each layout.

## 2. Map Sitemap Pages to Components
- For each page in the sitemap, map it to a static component and its corresponding layout file.
- Create a mapping table (page → component → layout) for clarity.

## 3. Create Static Components
- For each mapped page/component:
  - Create a new Vue component in the appropriate directory (e.g., `storyblok/` or a new `components/` folder).
  - Name components according to the mapping (e.g., `PageHomepage.vue`, `PageProductBrand.vue`).

## 4. Generate HTML Structure
- For each component:
  - Use the structure and sections from the referenced layout file.
  - Write the HTML using semantic tags and Tailwind CSS classes for styling, responsive, and mobile-first design.
  - Add placeholder content and elements to simulate real user interactions (e.g., buttons, forms, links).

## 5. Add Analytics Event Hooks
- Insert Vue event hooks (`@click`, `@submit`, etc.) on interactive elements to simulate analytics tracking points.
- Add comments or dummy methods to indicate where analytics events (e.g., page view, button click) would be triggered.

## 6. Ensure Analytics Readiness
- For each page/component, ensure the following analytics event points are present:
  - Page view (on mount)
  - Navigation clicks (e.g., home → product)
  - Download clicks
  - Scroll depth (add a placeholder for scroll event)
  - Contact form events (submit, input focus)
  - Minimum visit duration (add a placeholder for timer logic)

## 7. Use Tailwind CSS for All Styling
- Apply Tailwind CSS classes for all layout, spacing, color, and responsive design.
- Ensure all components are mobile-first and adapt to different screen sizes.

## 8. Document Component Structure
- For each component, add comments or a README section describing:
  - The layout used
  - Key analytics event points
  - Any special simulation logic

## 9. Validate and Refine
- Review each component for completeness, clarity, and adherence to the PRD.
- Ensure all required HTML, styling, and analytics hooks are present.

## 10. Register Components in Storyblok Manually
- Register each static component in Storyblok, matching the sitemap structure for simulation.
